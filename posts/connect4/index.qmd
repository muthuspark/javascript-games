        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The game is played between two players: <span class="highlight">Player 1</span> and <span class="highlight">Player 2</span>.</li>
            <li>Each player takes turns choosing one of the 7 columns and drops their disc into it. <span class="highlight">Player 1</span> uses <span class="highlight">red discs</span>, and <span class="highlight">Player 2</span> uses <span class="highlight">yellow discs</span>.</li>
            <li>The discs fall straight down to the next available space in the column.</li>
            <li>The goal is to form a line of four discs of your own color. This line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.</li>
            <li>If all the spaces on the grid are filled and neither player has connected four discs, the game ends in a draw.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>A player wins by forming a continuous line of four of their discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to do so is declared the winner!</p>
