The game starts with several piles of objects. On your turn, you must take at least one object from exactly one pile. You can take as many objects as you want from that pile. The player who takes the last object loses the game."},{question:"What is the winning strategy in Nim?",answer:'The winning strategy involves calculating the "Nim sum" - the XOR of all pile sizes. If the Nim sum is non-zero, you can always make a move to make it zero, putting your opponent in a losing position. The AI on hard difficulty uses this optimal strategy.'},{question:"What are the different difficulty levels?",answer:"Easy: AI makes random moves. Medium: AI plays optimally 50% of the time.
