You make guesses by selecting colors and submitting them. After each guess, you receive feedback: black pegs mean a color is correct and in the right position, white pegs mean a color is correct but in the wrong position. Use this feedback to deduce the secret code within 10 guesses."},{question:"What do the feedback pegs mean?",answer:"Black pegs indicate you have the right color in the right position. White pegs indicate you have a correct color but in the wrong position. No peg means that color is not in the code (or all instances are already accounted for). The pegs do not tell you which specific colors they refer to."},{question:"What is a good strategy for Mastermind?",answer:'Start with a guess using different colors to gather maximum information. Pay attention to how many pegs you get. If you get 2 black pegs, try keeping 2 colors in their positions and changing the others. Eliminate colors systematically based on feedback. Some players use the "1-1-2-2" starting pattern to efficiently narrow down possibilities.'},{question:"Can colors repeat in Mastermind?",answer:"In this version, yes! The secret code can contain the same color multiple times. This adds complexity because you need to consider that a color might appear more than once in the solution."}]},l=[{name:"Home",path:"/"},{name:"Games",path:"/"},{name:t.shortTitle||t.title,path:`/posts/${t.slug}/`}];return d(t.slug,t.initCode),m(t),(P,s)=>(r(),a("article",f,[i(p,{items:l}),e("header",k,[e("h1",w,n(t.title),1),e("p",v,n(t.description),1),e("div",G,[(r(!0),a(b,null,y(t.categories,c=>(r(),a("span",{key:c,class:"badge bg-success me-2",itemprop:"genre"},n(c),1))),128))])]),s[0]||(s[0]=e("section",{class:"game-section","aria-label":"Game Area"},[e("div",{id:"game_main_container",class:"game-container"},[e("div",{id:"secretCode",class:"secret-code"}),e("div",{class:"legend"},[e("div",{class:"legend-item"},[e("div",{class:"legend-pin black"}),e("span",null,"Correct color & position")]),e("div",{class:"legend-item"},[e("div",{class:"legend-pin white"}),e("span",null,"Correct color, wrong position")])]),e("div",{id:"board"}),e("div",{id:"colorPalette",class:"color-palette"}),e("div",{class:"controls"},[e("button",{class:"primary",onclick:"submitGuess()"},"Submit Guess"),e("button",{class:"secondary",onclick:"undoLastColor()"},"Undo"),e("button",{class:"secondary",onclick:"clearCurrentGuess()"},"Clear"),e("button",{class:"danger",onclick:"newGame()"},"New Game")]),e("div",{class:"stats"},[e("div",null,[o("Guesses: "),e("span",{id:"guessCount"},"0 / 10")]),e("div",null,[o("Won: "),e("span",{id:"gamesWon"},"0")]),e("div",null,[o("Played: "),e("span",{id:"gamesPlayed"},"0")]),e("div",null,[o("Win Rate: "),e("span",{id:"winRate"},"0%")])]),e("div",{id:"message",class:"message"}),e("p",{class:"instructions"}," Crack the secret 4-color code!
