One player (Blue) tries to connect the top edge to the bottom edge, while the other player (Red) tries to connect the left edge to the right edge. Players take turns placing one piece on any empty cell. The first player to create a connected path between their two sides wins. The game was invented independently by mathematician Piet Hein in 1942 and John Nash in 1948."},{question:"Is there always a winner in Hex?",answer:'Yes! Unlike many strategy games, Hex cannot end in a draw. This is because the board can only be completely filled when one player has formed a winning connection. Mathematically, this is known as the "Hex theorem" - when the board is full, exactly one player must have a winning path.'},{question:"What is a good strategy for Hex?",answer:`Key strategies include: 1) Control the center of the board, as central positions connect to more cells. 2) Create "bridges" - pairs of cells that can be connected on your next turn regardless of your opponent's move. 3) Think ahead and visualize possible paths. 4) Block your opponent while building your own connection. The first player has a theoretical advantage, which is why the "swap rule" is sometimes used in competitive play.`},{question:"What do the different difficulty levels mean?",answer:"Easy: AI makes random moves. Medium: AI uses simple heuristics like preferring center positions and building connections. Hard: AI evaluates board positions more deeply, looking for winning moves and blocking opportunities. Larger board sizes (9x9, 11x11) provide more complex strategic depth."}]},c=[{name:"Home",path:"/"},{name:"Games",path:"/"},{name:t.shortTitle||t.title,path:`/posts/${t.slug}/`}];return p(t.slug,t.initCode),d(t),(G,a)=>(l(),s("article",f,[n(m,{items:c}),e("header",w,[e("h1",x,i(t.title),1),e("p",v,i(t.description),1),e("div",_,[(l(!0),s(y,null,b(t.categories,r=>(l(),s("span",{key:r,class:"badge bg-success me-2",itemprop:"genre"},i(r),1))),128))])]),a[0]||(a[0]=e("section",{id:"game_main_container",class:"game-section","aria-label":"Game Area"},[e("div",{class:"game-controls"},[e("label",{for:"boardSizeSelect"},"Board Size:"),e("select",{id:"boardSizeSelect",onchange:"changeBoardSize()"},[e("option",{value:"5"},"5x5"),e("option",{value:"7",selected:""},"7x7"),e("option",{value:"9"},"9x9"),e("option",{value:"11"},"11x11")]),e("label",{for:"difficultySelect"},"Difficulty:"),e("select",{id:"difficultySelect",onchange:"changeDifficulty()"},[e("option",{value:"easy"},"Easy"),e("option",{value:"medium",selected:""},"Medium"),e("option",{value:"hard"},"Hard")]),e("button",{class:"new-game-btn",onclick:"newGame()"},"New Game")]),e("div",{id:"gameStatus"},"Your turn - Click a cell to place your piece"),e("div",{class:"game-info"},[e("div",{class:"player-info"},[e("div",{class:"player-indicator blue"}),e("span",{class:"player-label"},"You (Blue) - Connect Top to Bottom")]),e("div",{class:"player-info"},[e("div",{class:"player-indicator red"}),e("span",{class:"player-label"},"AI (Red) - Connect Left to Right")])]),e("div",{class:"board-container"},[e("div",{id:"hexBoard"})]),e("div",{class:"instructions-box"},[e("h3",null,"How to Play Hex"),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[e("span",{class:"goal-indicator"},[e("span",{class:"color-box blue"}),o(" Blue (You)")]),o(": Connect the top edge to the bottom edge")]),e("li",null,[e("span",{class:"goal-indicator"},[e("span",{class:"color-box red"}),o(" Red (AI)")]),o(": Connect the left edge to the right edge")]),e("li",null,"Take turns placing one piece on any empty cell"),e("li",null,"First player to create a connected path between their two sides wins"),e("li",null,"There are no draws in Hex - someone always wins!")])])],-1)),n(u,{faqs:t.faqs},null,8,["faqs"]),n(g,{currentSlug:t.slug,categories:t.categories},null,8,["currentSlug","categories"]),e("meta",{itemprop:"url",content:`https://games.muthu.co/posts/${t.slug}/`},null,8,H),e("meta",{itemprop:"image",content:`https://games.muthu.co/posts/${t.slug}/thumbnail.png`},null,8,S),a[1]||(a[1]=e("meta",{itemprop:"applicationCategory",content:"Game"},null,-1)),a[2]||(a[2]=e("meta",{itemprop:"operatingSystem",content:"Web Browser"},null,-1)),a[3]||(a[3]=e("span",{itemprop:"offers",itemscope:"",itemtype:"https://schema.org/Offer",style:{display:"none"}},[e("meta",{itemprop:"price",content:"0"}),e("meta",{itemprop:"priceCurrency",content:"USD"})],-1))]))}},q=h(k,[["__scopeId","data-v-5a7e45bf"]]);export{q as default};
