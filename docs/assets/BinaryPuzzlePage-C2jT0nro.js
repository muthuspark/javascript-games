Each row and column must have equal numbers of both digits, no more than two consecutive same digits, and all rows and columns must be unique."},{question:"How do you solve a Binary Puzzle?",answer:"Start by looking for cells where only one value is possible. If placing a 0 would create three 0s in a row, place a 1. If a row already has half its cells filled with one digit, fill the rest with the other. Use the uniqueness rule to eliminate possibilities."},{question:"Is Binary Puzzle good for your brain?",answer:"Yes! Binary Puzzle improves logical thinking, pattern recognition, and deductive reasoning. The simple rules but complex solutions make it an excellent brain training exercise for all ages."},{question:"What makes Binary Puzzle different from Sudoku?",answer:"While both are logic puzzles, Binary Puzzle uses only two symbols (0 and 1) instead of nine. The rules are different too - you must balance digit counts, avoid three in a row, and ensure uniqueness of rows and columns."}]},r=[{name:"Home",path:"/"},{name:"Games",path:"/"},{name:s.shortTitle||s.title,path:`/posts/${s.slug}/`}];return u(s.slug,s.initCode),c(s),(P,t)=>(l(),a("article",y,[i(m,{items:r}),e("header",f,[e("h1",b,n(s.title),1),e("p",w,n(s.description),1),e("div",k,[(l(!0),a(h,null,z(s.categories,o=>(l(),a("span",{key:o,class:"badge bg-success me-2",itemprop:"genre"},n(o),1))),128))])]),t[0]||(t[0]=e("section",{id:"game_main_container",class:"game-section","aria-label":"Game Area"},[e("div",{class:"binary-puzzle"},[e("div",{class:"difficulty-controls"},[e("button",{class:"difficulty easy selected",onclick:"setDifficulty('easy')"},"Easy (6x6)"),e("button",{class:"difficulty medium",onclick:"setDifficulty('medium')"},"Medium (8x8)"),e("button",{class:"difficulty hard",onclick:"setDifficulty('hard')"},"Hard (10x10)")]),e("div",{class:"timer",id:"timer"},"00:00"),e("div",{class:"controls"},[e("button",{onclick:"newGame()"},"New Game")]),e("div",{class:"grid",id:"grid"}),e("div",{class:"message",id:"message"}),e("div",{class:"rules"},[e("h3",null,"Rules"),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"Fill the grid with 0s and 1s"),e("li",null,"Each row and column must have equal numbers of 0s and 1s"),e("li",null,"No more than two consecutive 0s or 1s in any row or column"),e("li",null,"All rows must be unique, and all columns must be unique"),e("li",null,"Click a cell to cycle: empty → 0 → 1 → empty")])])])],-1)),i(d,{faqs:s.faqs},null,8,["faqs"]),i(p,{currentSlug:s.slug,categories:s.categories},null,8,["currentSlug","categories"]),e("meta",{itemprop:"url",content:`https://games.muthu.co/posts/${s.slug}/`},null,8,_),e("meta",{itemprop:"image",content:`https://games.muthu.co/posts/${s.slug}/thumbnail.png`},null,8,v),t[1]||(t[1]=e("meta",{itemprop:"applicationCategory",content:"Game"},null,-1)),t[2]||(t[2]=e("meta",{itemprop:"operatingSystem",content:"Web Browser"},null,-1)),t[3]||(t[3]=e("span",{itemprop:"offers",itemscope:"",itemtype:"https://schema.org/Offer",style:{display:"none"}},[e("meta",{itemprop:"price",content:"0"}),e("meta",{itemprop:"priceCurrency",content:"USD"})],-1))]))}},S=g(B,[["__scopeId","data-v-08eeaf82"]]);export{S as default};
