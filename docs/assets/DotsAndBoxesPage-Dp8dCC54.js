The game starts with a grid of dots. Players take turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines between adjacent dots. When a player draws the fourth side of a box, they claim that box and get another turn. The player with the most boxes when the grid is full wins."},{question:"What is the best strategy for Dots and Boxes?",answer:"The key strategy is to avoid drawing the third side of any box, as this gives your opponent a free box. Try to create chains where completing one box leads to completing many more. Sometimes sacrificing a few boxes early can let you claim a larger chain later. The AI on hard difficulty uses these strategic concepts."},{question:"What do the different difficulty levels mean?",answer:"Easy: AI makes random moves. Medium: AI captures available boxes but sometimes makes suboptimal moves. Hard: AI uses strategic thinking to avoid giving away boxes and tries to create winning chains. Try the larger grid sizes for more complex games!"}]},r=[{name:"Home",path:"/"},{name:"Games",path:"/"},{name:s.shortTitle||s.title,path:`/posts/${s.slug}/`}];return c(s.slug,s.initCode),d(s),(S,t)=>(n(),a("article",b,[o(m,{items:r}),e("header",x,[e("h1",f,i(s.title),1),e("p",v,i(s.description),1),e("div",w,[(n(!0),a(h,null,y(s.categories,l=>(n(),a("span",{key:l,class:"badge bg-success me-2",itemprop:"genre"},i(l),1))),128))])]),t[0]||(t[0]=e("section",{id:"game_main_container",class:"game-section","aria-label":"Game Area"},[e("div",{class:"game-container"},[e("div",{class:"controls"},[e("select",{id:"gridSizeSelect",class:"grid-select",onchange:"changeGridSize()"},[e("option",{value:"3"},"3x3 (2x2 boxes)"),e("option",{value:"4",selected:""},"4x4 (3x3 boxes)"),e("option",{value:"5"},"5x5 (4x4 boxes)"),e("option",{value:"6"},"6x6 (5x5 boxes)")]),e("select",{id:"difficultySelect",class:"difficulty-select",onchange:"changeDifficulty()"},[e("option",{value:"easy"},"Easy"),e("option",{value:"medium",selected:""},"Medium"),e("option",{value:"hard"},"Hard")]),e("button",{onclick:"newGame()"},"New Game")]),e("div",{id:"gameStatus",class:"game-status"},"Your turn - Click a line to draw"),e("div",{class:"score-board"},[e("div",{class:"score-item player-1"},[e("div",{class:"score-label"},"You"),e("div",{class:"score-value",id:"playerScore"},"0")]),e("div",{class:"score-item player-2"},[e("div",{class:"score-label"},"AI"),e("div",{class:"score-value",id:"aiScore"},"0")])]),e("div",{id:"gameBoard"}),e("div",{class:"legend"},[e("div",{class:"legend-item"},[e("div",{class:"legend-color player-1"}),e("span",null,"Your boxes")]),e("div",{class:"legend-item"},[e("div",{class:"legend-color player-2"}),e("span",null,"AI boxes")])]),e("div",{class:"rules"},[e("h4",null,"How to Play"),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"Click on a line between two dots to draw it"),e("li",null,"Complete a box by drawing its fourth side to claim it"),e("li",null,"When you complete a box, you get another turn"),e("li",null,"The player with the most boxes at the end wins")])])])],-1)),o(p,{faqs:s.faqs},null,8,["faqs"]),o(u,{currentSlug:s.slug,categories:s.categories},null,8,["currentSlug","categories"]),e("meta",{itemprop:"url",content:`https://games.muthu.co/posts/${s.slug}/`},null,8,_),e("meta",{itemprop:"image",content:`https://games.muthu.co/posts/${s.slug}/thumbnail.png`},null,8,B),t[1]||(t[1]=e("meta",{itemprop:"applicationCategory",content:"Game"},null,-1)),t[2]||(t[2]=e("meta",{itemprop:"operatingSystem",content:"Web Browser"},null,-1)),t[3]||(t[3]=e("span",{itemprop:"offers",itemscope:"",itemtype:"https://schema.org/Offer",style:{display:"none"}},[e("meta",{itemprop:"price",content:"0"}),e("meta",{itemprop:"priceCurrency",content:"USD"})],-1))]))}},q=g(D,[["__scopeId","data-v-38c42982"]]);export{q as default};
